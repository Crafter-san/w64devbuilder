# w64devbuilder
Build helper for w64devkit and possibly mingw, and possibly other mediums.

**Builder Executable is inside the releases tab** [HERE](https://github.com/Crafter-san/w64devbuilder/releases/tag/v2.0)


TODO:

* Add custom text editor.
* Add more complex commands.
* Add ability to push and pull from Github automatically and manually.
* Make it usable without w64devkit (Maybe), or make my own devkit
